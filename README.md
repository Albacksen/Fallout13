##Fallout 13 transition stage

**Website:** http://wasteland.expert <BR>
**Devblog:** https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout13 <BR>
**Code:** https://github.com/BartNixon/Fallout13 <BR>

##Transition
If you see this, it means the master branch is temporarily empty.
We are currently coming through the global transition to a newer and much better version of a build.
The old (but functional) build is safely preserved here on the Git at [special legacy branch](https://github.com/BartNixon/Fallout13/tree/legacy).
New build is being polished and prepared for the release in the master branch.
The release is planned on the next several days depending on the ammount of primary work we have left.
Please stand by.
